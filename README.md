# No Roblox, You Can't Look!
*nrycl (also sometimes known as nrycls) is pronounced NER-RYE-kul(s) ;)*

nrycl-chat is an encrypted chat system that works around filter restrictions and protects the end-user from TOS strikes.

It also introduces a whole host of amazing new features, such as rich text integration, in-line images, link embeds, commands, and more!

**nrycls is in <span style="font-size: 16px;">*VERY EARLY*</span> development at the moment, so don't expect much.**
